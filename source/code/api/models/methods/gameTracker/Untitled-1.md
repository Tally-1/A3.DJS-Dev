A litle more info:

So I am very happy to finally be able to publish this work, and I really hope you like it!

With regards to future developement I need two things from you guys:

Feedback. I need to know what to add and where the bugs I have not spotted are.

Contributions. This could be anything, a good suggestion, a proper bug-report, a pull-request on gitHub 
or financial allowing me to free up time that would otherwise be spent working on paid projects.

The easiest way to get in touch with me is via Discord. You can Join the A3.DJS server here[link].

If you feel like buying me a pizza you can donate here[link]

Allright! That should be it for now! Enjoy!

Best regards, Tally!
